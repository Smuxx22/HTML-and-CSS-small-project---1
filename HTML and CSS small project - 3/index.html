            Warranty,
            do not use the Product and return it within the return period stated in the XUPERMASK Return
            Policy.
        </b>
    </p>

    <p><b>Who is covered by the warranty?</b></p>
    <p>Only an end-user who purchases the product either directly from XUPERMASK OPCO LLC (hereinafter “XUPERMASK”)
        or
        from an authorized dealer of XUPERMASK in the region or country in which the end-user is located
        (“end-user”) is
        eligible for the Limited Warranty. </p>
    <h4>LIMITED WARRANTY</h4>
    <p>Subject to the terms and conditions, XUPERMASK warrants for a period of one (1) year from the date of
        original
        retail purchase by the end-user or from the receipt date for online orders and pre-orders (!Warranty
        Period”)
        that the product will function without material defects in design, materials, and workmanship under normal
        and
        customary consumer usage and conditions and under any XUPERMASK written guidelines, requirements, or
        instructions, including, for example, environmental and storage requirements. Any nonconformity will be
        reported
        to XUPERMASK in a form and with supporting information reasonably requested by XUPERMASK to enable it to
        verify,
        diagnose, and correct the nonconformity. </p>
    <h4>WARRANTY CONDITIONS AND EXCLUSIONS</h4>
    <p>The Product must be used in accordance with any instructions provided with the Product. This Warranty does
        not
        apply should the defect in or failure of the Product be attributable to misuse, abuse, accident, or failure
        to
        comply with instructions on the part of the user. </p>
    <h4>THE WARRANTY IS VALID ONLY IF:</h4>
    <p>(i) the original receipt issued to the original end-user by a XUPERMASK authorized dealer, specifying the
        date of
        purchase and serial number, is presented with the product to be repaired or replaced;</p>
    <p>(ii) none of the seals or serial numbers on the face of the product have been tampered with, removed, or
        defaced;
        and</p>
    <p>(iii) the product has not been altered, modified, damaged, abused, or neglected in any manner by the end-user
        or
        user or anyone else.</p>
    <p>The Warranty shall not apply to:<br>
        (a) consumable parts, such as HEPA filters or batteries that are designed to diminish over time, unless
        failure
        has occurred due to a defect in materials or workmanship;</p>
    <p>(b) cosmetic damage, including but not limited to, scratches, dents, and broken plastic on ports, as well as
        normal wear and tear or otherwise due to the normal aging of the device; and</p>
    <p>(c) use of the product in combination with any third-party devices or products that have not been provided or
        recommended by XUPERMASK.</p>
    <h4>WHAT WILL XUPERMASK DO?</h4>
    <p>If, after due examination, XUPERMASK concludes in its sole discretion that the product has failed to satisfy
        the
        Warranty during the Warranty Period, XUPERMASK or its authorized service provider will, at XUPERMASK’s
        discretion, either repair or replace the product in accordance with the conditions stipulated herein. </p>
    <p>This section states end-user’s sole and exclusive remedy, and XUPERMASK’s sole and exclusive liability, for
        any
        breach of the Warranty by XUPERMASK with respect to the Product. </p>
    <p>If XUPERMASK or its authorized service provider repairs or replaces the product (such repaired or replaced
        product, the !Replacement”), the Replacement shall be warranted for the remaining time of the original
        warranty
        period or for ninety (90) days from the date of repair or replacement, whichever is longer. Repair or
        replacement may involve the use of functionally equivalent used, previously installed, or reconditioned
        units or
        parts. The parts or components that were replaced will become the property of XUPERMASK. All warranty
        returns
        must be sent to the company’s designated address with prior written approval by XUPERMASK, and the following
        information must be provided: </p>
    <p>1. Original purchase receipt, package, and accessories</p>
    <p>2. Model number, color, and size</p>
    <p>3. Serial number</p>
    <p>4. Your contact information (name and phone number)</p>
    <p>The Product must be returned with freight prepaid. If XUPERMASK determines that a Product returned by an
        end-user
        does not comply with this Warranty, then the end-user will also bear XUPERMASK’s cost of shipping the
        Product
        back to the end-user. </p>
    <p>The Warranty is in addition to other statutory rights and remedies the end-user may have under applicable
        laws
        where the product is sold. To obtain any applicable statutory rights or related warranty information or
        service
        in such cases, please first contact the dealer from which you purchased the Product, or the distributor that
        supplied the Product.</p>
    <p><b>DISCLAIMERS: The Warranty set forth herein is exclusive and in lieu of all other warranties or conditions
            relating to the Product, and XUPERMASK expressly disclaims all other warranties and conditions, whether
            express,
            implied, or statutory, including any implied warranties of merchantability, non-infringement, fitness
            for a
            particular purpose, and any warranties arising out of course of dealing or usage of trade and against
            hidden
            defects, to the fullest extent permitted by law. XUPERMASK does not warrant that the Product will meet
            end-user’s requirements or that use of the Product will be uninterrupted or error free. No advice or
            information, whether oral or written, obtained from XUPERMASK or elsewhere will create any warranty not
            expressly stated in this warranty. </b></p>
    <p>XUPERMASK must be worn correctly and according to the user guide. XUPERMASK may not perform as desired if the
        XUPERMASK is stored outside of a room temperature environment with reasonable levels of humidity and
        protected
        from extremes of excessive or prolonged heat or cold. </p>
    <p>
        XUPERMASK may not perform as desired if the HEPA filters are found to be inserted incorrectly. XUPERMASK may
        not
        perform as desired if the HEPA filters are exposed to liquid, excessive heat or cold, or other extreme
        environmental conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please review the user guide, product labeling, and hang tags carefully. Any warranty is void if the
        XUPERMASK
        or any of its component parts are found, in our sole discretion, to be misused by excessive stretching,
        pulling,
        tightening or force, opening, tampering,
    </p>
    <p>
        or altering with the fans, motors, wiring, hardware, or any other components of the XUPERMASK; altering,
        defacing, or removing any of the external branding or engraving including the serial number and other
        markings
        on XUPERMASK, or removal of any external components of the XUPERMASK that is not outlined in the user guide.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please review the user guide, product labeling, packaging, and package inserts, and hang tags carefully. Any
        warranty is void if the XUPERMASK is subjected to excessive moisture including, but not limited to,
        excessive
        sweating or applying sprays or liquids inside the XUPERMASK in a manner that interferes with the
        functionality
        of the PCB board or other electronic components.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please review the user guide, product labeling, packaging, and package inserts, and hang tags carefully. Any
        warranty will be void and XUPERMASK may not perform as desired if the mask is exposed to direct sunlight,
        rain,
        fog, heat, cold, or other excessive environmental condition for an extended period.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please review the user guide, product labeling, packaging, and package inserts, and hang tags carefully. Any
        warranty is void in the event that the product becomes damage or does not work as desired due to the failure
        to
        follow the instructions.

        XUPERMASK is for adult use only and not intended for anyone under 16. XUPERMASK contains small parts and is
        not
        a toy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, so the above limitation
        may
        not apply to you. This warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which
        vary
        by jurisdiction.
    </p>
    <p>
        When charging your Xupermask, always use common sense, handle carefully, and use proper precautions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Do not charge your Xupermask when there is moisture present, or the ports, cables, bat teries, or any
        components
        are wet, including from perspiration or environmental condi tions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Do not charge your Xupermask with damaged cables, power adaptors, or chargers. Take time to examine
        connectors,
        cables, and plugs and do not use if damaged, frayed, or bent.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using damaged cables or chargers or charging when moisture is present or under wet conditions, can cause
        fire,
        electric shock, injury, or damage to your Xupermask or other property.
    </p>
    <p>
        Do not charge your Xupermask while sleeping.
    </p>
    <p>
        When charging your Xupermask, make sure the USB connector is fully inserted into both the Xupermask charging
        port and a compatible power adapter or portable charging unit. Only charge your Xupermask using an ordinary
        household outlet or a suitable portable
    </p>
    <p>
        battery recharging unit. Charge your Xupermask in a well ventilated area and avoid con tact with metallic
        foreign objects (for example, coins, keys, jewelry, or other batteries) as these foreign objects may become
        warm
        or otherwise interfere with charging.
    </p>
    <p>
        Avoid prolonged skin contact with the charging cable and connectors when the charg ing cable is connected to
        a
        power source because it may cause discomfort of injury. Take special care if you have a physical condition
        that
        affects your ability to detect heat against the body.
